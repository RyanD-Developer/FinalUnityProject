Day 1 : We did nothing so far but just yapping
Day 2 : same
Day 3 : pitches
Day 4 : pitches
Day 5 : started GDD
Day 6: dont understand why GDD need to be done so soon when we will differ from them as such a small group without need for much planning
Day 7: Devin worked on GDD enough, Ryan is helping ashton then working on GDD.
Day 8: Ryan didnt wake up because he stayed up to late, no work done from him, very sorry
Day 9: Planned Activities are wrapping up GDD and (if time permits) setting up unity version control + githubs initial commit + planning tasks for each person 
Day 10: Deven is sick, GDD done though, planning project thoroughly before development starts.
